Context
==========

In the context of the EJP-RD project, an overlap analysis between a list of genes targeted by vitamins A&D and pathways
related to CAKUT disease was performed (Ozisik *et al.*, 2021 [1]_).

For the vitamin A analysis, data was retrieved from
several sources: the `Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) <https://ctdbase.org/>`_ [2]_ and the study of Balmer and
Blomhoff [3]_ for the target genes, and WikiPathways (WP) [4]_, Reactome [5]_ and Gene Ontology (GO) [6]_:sup:`,` [7]_
for the disease-associated genes.
